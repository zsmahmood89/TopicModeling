	This file relies on the output from the previous SET of scripts, and creates the "*seq.dat" file to run David Blei's (2003) Dynamic Topic Model. 

	You'll have the option of interactively editing the months, should you choose. For example, if you misspelled a month "Nvember", my function won't recognize it so I can convert it to a number; the "interactive" mode will allow you to directly input it in your compiler as "11". 

	You also have the option of specifying daily; monthly; quarterly; bi-annual; or annual time slices. 

	OUTPUT:

		"full-seq.dat"
